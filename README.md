# Rune Light - The Safer Client.


- Pretty much every plugin has had the API removed.
- Chat Commands has had some commands removed (No API).
- WorldHopper/DefaultWorld plugin try to use the local service or fallback to [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/).
- [Grand Exchange Shows osBuddy average](https://i.imgur.com/6Oohf32.png) on search.
- Item Price plugin shows osBuddy price in bank if its higher.
- GroundItems plugin shows osBuddy price on the ground if its higher.

[osBuddy prices only work with your own HTTP-Service](https://github.com/Hermetism/runelight/wiki/SETUP-YOUR-OWN-HTTP-SERVICE)

## HELPER PLUGIN
Most of Helper Plugins best features work with the [STRETCHED MODE with these settings](https://i.imgur.com/eY9AlTD.png)

There are **MANY** other features but some of them are listed below.

- HELPER is *Static*, so you can use it in any plugin with VERY little effort.
- Move mouse using Fitts Law (Commented Out)
- Move mouse using Berstein Polynominals (Commented Out, inaccurate)
- Mouse mouse using [Natural Mouse (RS Version)](https://github.com/Hermetism/Natural-Mouse-RS)
- Mark bank booths in entire regions
- Manage and Compare Inventory and Bank (some deprecated)
- Find random area to click on Widgets and WidgetItems
- Find tile area (1 tile or several at once)
- Example Generics/Enums
- I'm really under selling this go [read everything here](runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/helpers).
